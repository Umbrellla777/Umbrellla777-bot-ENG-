# Umbrellla777-bot-ENG-
Python a script for beautiful text design in Telegram

# For Termux
1) Moving on to https://my.telegram.org/  <br/>
Enter your phone number in the field **Your Phone Number**  <br/>
After the confirmation code arrives, enter it in the field **Confirmation code**  <br/>
And press the button **Sign In**  <br/>

2) Creating our own "application"
In the field **App Tittle** writing **Your name**  <br/>
In the field **Short** Name writing **Your name**  <br/>
In **Platform** choose **Other**  <br/>
And press button **Create Application**  <br/>

3) We copy it somewhere **api_id** Ð¸ **api_hash**  <br/>
**api_id** these are numbers like **1234567**  <br/>
**api_hash** these are both letters and numbers of the type **123sdf123sdf234...**  <br/>

4) Installing the application **Termux**.  <br/>

5) Open Termux and insert the following command into it:
```bash
pkg update -y && pkg install -y git && pkg install -y python3 && git clone https://github.com/Umbrellla777/Umbrellla777-bot-ENG- && cd Umbrellla777-bot-ENG- && chmod +777 install.sh && sh install.sh && cd ..
```
I will briefly explain the commands:
```bash
pkg update -y # Checking for package updates and installing them
pkg install -y git # Installing the git version control system
pkg install -y python3 # Installing the YAP Interpreter python 3
git clone https://github.com/Umbrellla777/Umbrellla777-bot-ENG- # After installing git, download the repository with the script
cd Umbrellla777-bot-ENG- # Go to the directory with the script
chmod +777 install.sh # We give all the rights to the file, including for execution
sh install.sh # Running the script
cd .. # Exit to from the directory Umbrellla777-bot-ENG-
```

After inserting the command, press Enter (new line). <br/>
The script will be installed.  <br/>
If you have done everything correctly, you will see the inscriptions:  <br/>
***[Completed] The installation is successfully completed!"***  <br/>
***[Launch] Do the following./start api_id api_hash"***

6)Running the script.  <br/>
In Termux writing **./start your_api_id your_api_hash**  <br/>
Example of a command **./start 1234567 1d12d45fg56g563**  <br/>
And press Enter. After a couple of seconds, you will be asked to enter your number again, enter, get the code, enter the code and that's it!  <br/>

Upon successful launch, there will be a strip:  <br/>
***[PROFILE: My name | Id: 123345567 | Uname: @MyUserName]***

7) Commands  <br/>
The entire list of commands after starting the bot is called by the command .help <br/>
